# EIP-712 Test App

Test dapp for EIP-712 signature testing.

## Setup

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 12
  - If you are using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (recommended) running `nvm use` will automatically choose the right node version for you.
- Install [Yarn v1](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- Run `yarn setup` to install dependencies and run any required post-install scripts
  - **Warning:** Do not use the `yarn` / `yarn install` command directly. Use `yarn setup` instead. The normal install command will skip required post-install scripts, leaving your development environment in an invalid state.
- `yarn start` to run

## Reproduce locally

Lookup the `************ INSERT CODE SNIPPET HERE *************` flag in the code and insert the JS code sent to you in here.
